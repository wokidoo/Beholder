# Beholder
## A different way to DM
**Beholder is a cross-platform tool that aims to help game masters create, manage, and run
bigger and better tabletop roleplaying games!** It provides an expansive suite of deep, but simple 
to use, tools focused on helping users create campaigns and manage game sessions without having to 
keep it all in your head.
## RPG system agnostic
No matter what RPG system you use (Dungeons & Dragons, Call of Cthulhu, Gurps, etc.),
*Beholder* can help! Our objective is to provide a tool that can be used by anyone in
the TTRPG community!
